<!-- * The dirty way 

    * Why react was introduces,
Before react everything was DOM manipulation, If  we want to make our website dynamic then we needed to use DOM manipulation.Which was hard to do and that is why react was introduced
React makes DOM manipulation easy.  

* DOM manipulation is very hard to write as a developer, Making dynamic websites, with the primitives that DOM provides you is very hard. 

* This how things were done before React.

      // }

      /* Problem with this approach is that it is very hard to add and remove elements.
    And their is no central state.
    
    What if there is a Server where these todOS are put
    What if you update a TODO from your mobile app
    You will get back the new array Of TODOS on the frontend
    How will you update the DOM then?
    You only have a addTOdO function
    You don't have an updateTodo or remove Todo function yet

        const json = await res.json();
        updateDomAccToState(json.todos);
      }, 5000);
    </script>
    <!-- * The Better Approach

    * Don't clear the DOM upfront, update it based on what has changed.

    * Question is, how does It calculate what all has changed?
    * Has a todo been marked as complete?
    * Has a todo been deleted?

    The Answer: 

    * The better way is you calculate the difference between the old state and the new state and update that in the DOM
    
    * By remembering the old todos in a variable (virtual DOM)

    * What is the easiest way to create a dynamic fronted website?
    * Delegate the task of figuring out what has changed to the server using a hefty function
    * Tell the server what has changed and how to add, update, remove elements using the hefty function

    * All this usually do by React JS
