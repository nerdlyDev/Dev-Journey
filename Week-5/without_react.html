<!-- * To understand the react we need to understand what is DOM and it requires three most important things in react which are States, components and Re-rendering  -->

<!-- An object that represents the current state of the application. It represents the dynamic things in your app (things that changes) for example. in this code the counter button has a value of 0 -->

<!-- An object that represents a component. How a DOM element should render, given a state It is a re-usable,dynamic, HTML snippet that changes based on the state -->

<!-- A state change triggers a re-rendering.
A re-rendering represents the actual DOM being manipulated when the state changes -->
